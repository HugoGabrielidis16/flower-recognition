## Flower recognition




# Project description
Simple classification to recognize 5 differents types of flowers. Used this project to familiarize myself with :
  - TransferLearning using Keras, 
  - How to use wandb in order to generate the differents curves and how it can be used in order to replicate the experiments
  - How to analyse the results with differents metrics
  - Dockerizing my project in order to fix them in time & dependencies
